                        Hey there, I'm Vasantharan, currently pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Kongu Engineering College. While AI is my primary focus, I'm also drawn to the world of IoT problem-solving and embedded systems. I find joy in unraveling the hardware mysteries behind the software magic.
                        My journey goes beyond academics—I proudly serve as a Cadet in the SD Kongu Engineering College NCC Unit [15 (TN) BN, ERODE KOVAI GROUPS]. This experience has instilled discipline, leadership, and teamwork in me, qualities that complement my tech interests well.
                        But that's not all—besides coding, I've challenged myself by participating in four SSBs, two each for the Army and Navy. These experiences have taught me the essence of resilience and determination.
                        Let's explore the fusion of AI, IoT, and embedded systems. Connect with me as we push the boundaries of technology together!
